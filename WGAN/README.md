# WGAN

A minimal PyTorch implementation of [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875). This repository trains a simple MLP to generate MNIST images.

Here are some images generated by the model trained for 1500 epochs:

My main theoretical reference was [Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html), by Kevin Patrick Murphy.
